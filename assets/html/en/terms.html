<strong>Attention</strong>:<br />
This application <strong>IS NOT REPRESENTATIVE OF OR AFFILIATED WITH ANY ITALIAN GOVERNMENT AGENCY</strong>.
<br /><br />
It simply calculates the tax code using an algorithm from an external service,
therefore an Internet connection is required to use it.<br />
Furthermore, the algorithm is unable to distinguish cases of homocody.
In cases of homocody, the calculated tax code may not correspond to the real one.<br />
Please remember that the only 100% reliable tax identification code is the one issued by the
<strong>Agenzia delle Entrate</strong>.
<br /><br />
To acquire a new tax code through an identity document or health insurance card it is
necessary to take a photo that frames the entire front side of the document.<br />
The photo will not be stored on the device but will be processed by an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) algorithm
offered by Google Vision services.<br />
The algorithm may be imprecise, based on various factors (type of camera, quality and angle of the photo
taken, etc.) always check the acquired data.

We decline any responsibility for any illicit or improper use of the aforementioned app.
