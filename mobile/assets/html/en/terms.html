<strong>Attention</strong>:<br />
This application <strong>IS NOT REPRESENTATIVE OF OR AFFILIATED WITH ANY ITALIAN GOVERNMENT AGENCY</strong>.
<br /><br />
It simply calculates the tax code using an algorithm from an external service,
therefore an Internet connection is required to use it.<br />
Furthermore, the algorithm is unable to distinguish cases of homocody.
In cases of homocody, the calculated tax code may not correspond to the real one.<br />
Please remember that the only 100% reliable tax identification code is the one issued by the
<strong>Agenzia delle Entrate</strong>.
<br /><br />
The data entered and the tax codes calculated (i.e. all the data visible in the cards),
are stored on the secure Google cloud of your account.
The cloud saving is used EXCLUSIVELY to allow the user to
access the data stored from different devices with the same account and
the stored data will NEVER be shared with third parties.
<br /><br />
To acquire a new tax code through an identity document or health insurance card it is
necessary to take a photo that frames the entire front side of the document.<br />
The photo will not be stored on the device nor on the cloud, but will be processed by Vertex AI.<br />
The algorithm may be imprecise, based on various factors (type of camera, quality and angle of the photo
taken, etc.) always check the acquired data.
<br /><br />
We decline any responsibility for any illicit or improper use of the aforementioned app.
